## Project 1

This is my first project of phase 1 in bootcamp.
I have a simple webpage that displays the name of seven differet pokemon.
When clicked on the pokemon names will toggle between being "active" and "inactive".
When Active the pokemon names will turn green and when toggle inactive the name will turn gray.
A red button is also present and when double clicked it will alert the user that it has been clicked.
